Step-by-step instructions
Open the Project in VS Code

Launch Visual Studio Code.
Go to File  Open Folder... (or Open... on macOS).
Navigate to the directory where you have this project saved and select the project folder.
Open the Integrated Terminal

Once the project is open in VS Code, you can open the integrated terminal by going to Terminal  New Terminal in the top menu.
Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + (backtick).
Install Dependencies

In the newly opened terminal, type the following command and press Enter



npm install




This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary libraries and packages listed under dependencies and devDependencies. This might take a few moments.
Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. In the same terminal, type the following command and press Enter



npm run dev



This command will start the Vite development server. You will see output in the terminal indicating that the server is running, usually with a local URL like httplocalhost5173.
You can Ctrl + click on this URL in the terminal to open the application in your default web browser.
