- **Action**: Completely rebuilt the database schema from scratch
- **Result**: Production-ready schema with all necessary tables, relationships, and constraints

### 2. **Schema Updates & Compatibility**
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250821000002_schema_updates.sql`
- **Action**: Added missing fields and updated existing tables to match frontend expectations
- **Result**: Full compatibility with all frontend services and components

### 3. **Sample Data Population**
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250821000003_sample_data.sql`
- **Action**: Created comprehensive sample data for testing and demonstration
- **Result**: Realistic data including users, courses, assignments, submissions, and more

### 4. **Updated Type Definitions**
- **File**: `src/lib/database.types.ts`
- **Action**: Updated TypeScript types to match the new schema
- **Result**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support for database operations

2. **Optimized indexes** for better query performance
3. **Real-time subscriptions** enabled for live updates
4. **Proper foreign key relationships** with cascading deletes
5. **Comprehensive permission system** with role-based access control

### Frontend Integration
