# Smart Course Management System — Final Report

## Scope and status

This report summarizes what was delivered across schema, services, and UI; how it maps to requirements; key design choices; and what remains. The app runs via Vite, instructors can manage courses and record attendance, and the database schema is aligned with the frontend types. A DB-first path is implemented with a resilient localStorage fallback for demos.

## Requirements coverage

- Rewrite/update Supabase SQL to align with frontend: Done
  - Migrations: `supabase/migrations/20250821000001_complete_schema_rewrite.sql` (+ follow-ups `...02_schema_updates.sql`, `...03_sample_data.sql`)
  - Types aligned in `src/lib/database.types.ts` and domain types in `src/types/`

- Instructor can manage courses: Done
  - UI entry: `src/pages/Courses.tsx` → opens `CourseManagementModal`
  - Modal: `src/components/Courses/CourseManagementModal.tsx` (tabs: overview, students, assignments, attendance)

- Instructor sees registered students and can take/store attendance: Done (DB-first with fallback)
  - Service: `src/services/attendanceService.ts`
    - getCourseStudents → enrollments join (fallback mock when DB is empty/unavailable)
    - markSingleAttendance / markAttendance → upsert to DB and persist to localStorage (resilience)
  - UI: Attendance tab in `CourseManagementModal` with per-student controls, date picker, bulk actions, stats, and history

- Final project report: Delivered (this document).

Notes: End-to-end with your live Supabase requires seeded enrollments matching the logged-in instructor and RLS-compliant access. The fallback ensures the UI remains usable even if the DB isn’t populated yet.

## Architecture overview

- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind; lucide-react for icons.
- State/context: `src/context/AppContext.tsx` centralizes app state and actions.
- Service layer (Supabase access): `src/services/*` isolates data access from UI.
- Pages/components: `src/pages/*` and `src/components/*` compose features.
- Supabase/PostgreSQL: Auth, RLS-enforced tables, storage (migrations in `supabase/migrations`).

Key modules:

- Courses: `src/pages/Courses.tsx`, `src/components/Courses/*`, `src/services/courseService.ts`
- Attendance: `src/components/Courses/CourseManagementModal.tsx` (attendance tab), `src/services/attendanceService.ts`
- Assignments: `src/components/Assignments/*`, `src/services/assignmentService*.ts`
- Auth: `src/components/Auth/LoginModal.tsx`, `src/services/authService.ts`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`

## Design patterns and decisions

- Service layer abstraction: UI calls typed services; swapping DB/mock is easy (attendance fallback acts as an adapter).
- Context/provider: `useApp` provides session and shared actions without prop drilling.
- Modular UI composition: Pages orchestrate; components encapsulate tabs and cards.
- Defensive, demo-friendly fallback: Attendance services write to DB and mirror to localStorage; mock roster used if DB empty.
- Strong typing: Domain types in `src/types` and generated DB types in `src/lib/database.types.ts` reduce mismatch risk.

## Data model and security

- Core tables: profiles, courses, enrollments, assignments, submissions, attendance_records, notifications, file_uploads.
- RLS enabled + policies:
  - See `supabase/migrations/20250821000001_complete_schema_rewrite.sql` for `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and `CREATE POLICY` statements across all core tables.
  - Example coverage: per-user access on `profiles`, instructor-scoped access to `courses` and related `enrollments`, per-student access to own `submissions`, and instructor/course-scoped `attendance_records`.
- Sample data: `...03_sample_data.sql` seeds admin, instructors, students, courses, and enrollments to support demos.

## Key user flows and UI mapping

- Courses → Manage: `src/pages/Courses.tsx` lists courses; clicking Manage opens `CourseManagementModal`.
- Attendance marking:
  1) Modal → Attendance tab → pick date.
  2) For each student: set Present/Late/Absent; or use bulk Present/Absent.
  3) Save triggers `attendanceService.markSingleAttendance/markAttendance`.
  4) Stats and history can be toggled for at-a-glance insights.

## Contracts (example)

- attendanceService.markSingleAttendance
  - Input: `{ courseId: string, studentId: string, date: string (YYYY-MM-DD), status: 'present'|'late'|'absent' }`
  - Output: `{ ok: true }` or throws on DB error; always mirrors to localStorage as fallback.
  - Errors: RLS deny, network failure, invalid course/student IDs.

## Quality gates and verification

- Build/Dev: Vite dev server runs with HMR; Courses and Course Management render. If needed: ensure `.env` has `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Typecheck/Lint: Minor accessibility/deps warnings may appear in `CourseManagementModal` (labels/titles for inputs/buttons; effect deps). Functionality unaffected.
- Smoke test: Instructor can open a course, see students (DB or mock), set attendance, and see stats/history retained (DB and/or localStorage).

## Known gaps and next steps

- Confirm live DB path: Seed enrollments in your Supabase project so instructors see their rosters; validate RLS grants for attendance writes.
- Make fallback environment-conditional: gate localStorage mock via `import.meta.env.DEV` or a feature flag to avoid production drift.
- Accessibility: Add explicit labels/titles for controls in `CourseManagementModal`; address effect dependency warnings.
- Tests: Add unit tests for services (attendance/course) and component tests for the attendance tab.
- Indexes/Perf: Add/confirm indexes on foreign keys and common filters (e.g., `attendance_records(course_id, date)`).
